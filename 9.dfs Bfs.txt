DFS Path from node 0:
0 → 1 → 2 (backtrack) → 4 → 3 → 5

Result: 0 1 2 4 3 5

Step-by-step:
Level 0: Start at 0
         ↓
Level 1: Go to 1 (first neighbor)
         ↓
Level 2: Go to 2 (neighbor of 1)
         ↓
Backtrack: Return to 1
         ↓
Level 2: Go to 4 (next neighbor of 1)
         ↓
Level 3: Go to 3 (neighbor of 4)
         ↓
Level 4: Go to 5 (neighbor of 3).
